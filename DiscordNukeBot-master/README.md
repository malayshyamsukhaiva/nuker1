# Discord Nuke Bot
A Discord bot, made from Python, intended to nuke a server. Made for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDSHlAERINyHPbAkINm7OjQ?view_as=subscriber).

# Warning
This is **against** the Discord TOS (terms of service)! Please do not nuke a random server because you're bored. Only nuke a server that you created for the purpose of testing or had been granted permission to from the owner.

My own [server](https://discord.gg/ka35JqY) had been nuked before, so please do not nuke any server.

# Preparation
Before you start coding, make sure that you have a Python intepreter. You can use [repl.it](https://repl.it/~), which is online. Therefore, you do not need to install anything. Otherwise, you can use programs such as Visual Studio, IDLE, PyCharm, Atom, and Sublime Text. If so, make sure to follow the instructions below.

1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Press on the Download button. Make sure you add Python to PATH.
1. [Install Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/).

There's plenty of tutorials online, so if you're stuck, make sure to find a tutorial and follow their instructions.
